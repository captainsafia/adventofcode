## Feature requests and bugs

Please submit any feature requests or bugs as an [issue](https://github.com/martincostello/adventofcode/issues) in GitHub.

## Pull requests

If you wish to contribute code, please follow the guidelines below:

  1. Create an issue detailing the motivation for the change.
  1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
  1. Create a branch to work on your changes.
  1. Try to commit changes in a logical manner. Messy histories will be squashed if merged.
  1. Please follow the existing code style and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) formatting settings.
  1. Add any tests you deem appropriate.
  1. Ensure `Build.ps1` or `build.sh` runs with no errors or warnings.
  1. Open a pull request against the `master` branch, referencing your issue if appropriate.

Once your pull request is opened, the project maintainer will assess it for validity and an appropriate level of quality. For example, the [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/martincostello/adventofcode) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/martincostello/adventofcode) CI builds should pass.

If the project maintainer is satisfied that your contribution is appropriate it will be merged into the master branch when appropriate.
